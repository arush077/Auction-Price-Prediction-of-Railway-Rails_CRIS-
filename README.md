# Auction-Price-Prediction-of-Railway-Rails_CRIS-

Developed and Implemented a Machine Learning Model using the raw dataset, which was preprocessed using Excel and Pandas to predict the auction prices of different types of rail.

Rails of 52kg/60kg/50r/60r/75r/90r/50bh ( 1-->if it exists || 0->if it doesn't exist), on mentioning their length and weight the auction price of the lot could be predicted, using the model.
